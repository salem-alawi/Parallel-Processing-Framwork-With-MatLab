The problem involves cell-phone signals from cell-phone towers. We assume we have a fixed area
of land and a fixed number of towers (n). Each tower might have different power levels, so the
coverage radius may differ among towers (coverage represented by circles). We want to move
the locations of the towers, or centers of the circles, to maximize coverage. The towers must
stay within the area of land (these are our constraints). To maximize coverage, we will actually
minimize signal overlap. To compute signal overlap, we will compute intersection of two circles
for each pair of towers. Since the intersection of circles is a nonlinear function, and we constrain
the towers to stand within certain land area, this is a nonlinear programming problem.
